<h1>bouncingBall.fmu</h1>
The bouncingBall implements the following equation: 
<ul>
<li> der(h) = v;
<li> der(v) = -g;
<li> when h<0 then v := -e* v
</ul>
with start values h=1, e=0.7, g = 9.81 and
<ul>
<li> h: height [m], used as state
<li> v: velocity of ball [m/s], used as state
<li> der(h): velocity of ball [m/s]
<li> der(v): acceleration of ball [m/s2]
<li> g: acceleration of gravity [m/s2], a parameter
<li> e: a dimensionless parameter
</ul>

The figure shows the solution computed with Silver 
for height h of the ball for the start values given above.

<p>
The chain of events during simulation is as follows
<ol>
<li> initially h>0 and pos(0)=true </li>
<li> continuous integration until a state event is detected, i.e.
     until h + EPS_INDICATORS = 0.
     At this time h < 0, the EPS_INDICATORS adds hysteresis.</li>
<li> the simulator calls eventUpdate once which reverses the speed direction
     v of the ball: v = -e * v, and sets pos(0)=false</li>
<li> continuous integration until state event is detected, i.e.
     until h - EPS_INDICATORS = 0.
     At this time h > 0, the EPS_INDICATORS adds hysteresis.</li>
<li> the simulator calls  eventUpdate once more which sets pos(0)=true.</li>
<li> goto 2</li>
</ol>
